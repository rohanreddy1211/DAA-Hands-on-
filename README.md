Argue selection sort correctness. Solution: DAA Hands On 2/Correctnessofselectionsort.pdf

Benchmark the runtime of each algorithm. Your benchmarks should include information about your computer (RAM, CPU etc.) and be run with various input sizes; from small (array of size 5,10,20) up to large arrays (where your computer is struggling). I should see a plot of time vs input size n. Feel free to use benchmarking software.
